# Catchment Analyser
### Calculate catchments from multiple origins at multiple distances
==================
## About
This plugin takes a line-based network and point-based origin layer and calculated the distance from each segment within a given distance or list of distances to each of the origins. The tool outputs the catchment as lines and as a concave hull polygon layer. Credit for the concave hull functionality goes to the algorithm described by Adriano Moreira and Maribel Yasmina Santos.
