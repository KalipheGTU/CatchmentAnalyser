# Catchment Analyser
### Calculate catchments from multiple origins at multiple distances

## About
This plugin takes a line-based network and point-based origin layer and calculated the distance from each segment within a given distance or list of distances to each of the origins. The tool outputs the catchment as lines and as a concave hull polygon layer. Credit for the concave hull functionality goes to the algorithm described by Adriano Moreira and Maribel Yasmina Santos.

## Installation
The plug-in can be installed from the QGIS Plugins Manager, and updates become automatically available once submitted to the QGIS plugins repository.

## Software Requirements
QGIS (2.0 or above) - http://www.qgis.org/en/site/
